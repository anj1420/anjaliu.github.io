AIsha is an NLP-based chatbot that recommends top films to users based on their personal taste and engages in personal conversation. We used and finetuned a miniature BERT language model to classify intents from user input (i.e "greetings", "small talk", and "recommendation") that resulted in 97% accuracy.
