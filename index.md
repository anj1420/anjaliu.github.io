AIsha is an NLP-based chatbot that recommends top films to users based on their personal taste and engages in personal conversation. We used and finetuned a miniature BERT language model to classify intents from user input (i.e "greetings", "small talk", and "recommendation") that resulted in 97% accuracy.

Gender inequality in Hollywood and the media in general is a long-standing issue, related to the difference in pay between men and women, difference in opportunities and roles, ageism, and more. To support this enduring narrative, my project team and I created a series of Tableau visualizations that delve into statistics about the Hollywood film industry and its stars. Included in the link are questions we posed for a usability study, the results of which were then used for improving upon our work.

My project team and I analyzed survey data from the Open Sourcing for Mental Health organzation (OSMI) to predict how comfortable an employee would be to discuss mental health with a supervisor. To do so, we evaluated and ran various classification models and looked into several key features, such as employee demographics, mental health history, and employer services. Random Forest performed the best, giving us a 94% accuracy on our test data.
